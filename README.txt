# DiceMC Tiered Armors

Adds vanilla-esque armor progression that aims to stop the jumpt from no armor to iron with some logical intermediaries

## Upcoming Features
- wood armors (3 variants) for early game protection

- Dependnecy on Sewing Kit by Gigaherz for certain cloth and leather crafting
- cloth armor components (no armor value, dyeable)
- cloth as a base for leather
- cloth and leather as bases for higher tiered armors

### design philosophy

To give you an idea what my head space is for this mod and why I make certain choices and what might come to be.
As far as vanilla minecraft is concerned, armor is a "put it on and be done" kind of feature.  Sure you may end 
up breaking a piece here or there, but once you get to diamond, or now netherrite, it's pretty much ignored. This
means that all the other armors exist only to be thrown away or never used at all.  Mojang is somewhat bridging
that gap with gold items ignoring piglins (but let's be real you just use boots and full netherrite elsewhere)
and lether boots in 1.17 for not falling in snow (same as the gold boots).  So the future of Tiered armors will
attempt to make armors make more sense.  Certain armors may prevent the player from sprinting in the future due
to its weight.  I plan the wood armors to burn easily making them unsuitable for the nether.  depending on how
in depth I end up going into rendering, I may also look into armor layers so that you might be able to mix and
match layers especially if you have them dyed.
